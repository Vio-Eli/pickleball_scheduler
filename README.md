# PickleBall Scheduler

This is a Doubles Tournament Scheduler that optimizes for each person to team with every other person exactly once, and for each person to play against each other exactly once.

Further development will add:
- A GUI
- A way to input the number of courts available
- A way to specify the number of games each person will play. This lifts the constraint that each person must play against each other exactly once. However, still optimizes that for it's minimum.
- Teams Input and Single List Input (Currently takes two separate lists)
